Sky above, Voice within.
Sky guard you.
Wind guide you.
Breath and focus.
We are all in your debt, Dragonborn.
So... a Dragonborn appears, at this moment in the turning of the age.
Shout for us, Dragonborn. Then we may have time for questions.
Show us, Dragonborn. Let us taste of your Voice.
Do not be afraid. Your Shout will not harm us.
Strike us with the power of your Voice.
Shout at us, and let us taste of your Voice.
Dragonborn. It is you. Welcome to High Hrothgar.
Dovahkiin. You have tasted the Voice of the Greybeards, and passed through unscathed. High Hrothgar is open to you.
The Dragonrend Shout is evil. Would you cure one evil with another?
Alduin... we heard the Dragonrend Shout from here... you defeated him?
I can see it in your eyes - you've seen the land of the gods and returned. Does this mean... is it done? Is Alduin truly defeated?
