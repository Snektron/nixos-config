...ho ho ho, and hee hee hee, break that lute across my knee... and if the bard, should choose to fight, why then I'll set his clothes alight...	
Riften. Cicero likes Riften. Cheats and ruffians and cutthroats abound. Finally, some fun.	
...Cicero never understood thieves, really... take someone's things before you kill them? And they call me crazy...	
Brrrr... Chilly.	
Oohhh... Cicero's heard about the Butcher. Interesting knifework. Just... Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab! And then... Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab!	
Hmph. 'Solitude.' Lonely Cicero could tell you a thing or two about solitude...	
...the High King's court needs a jester... But not me. No, not Cicero. The Fool of Hearts is busy enough, thank you very much...	
...I saw a dwarf! I did! I did! Cicero saw a dwarf! There... Oh. No, sorry. No dwarf...	
...Forsworn think they're so scary... Cicero will show you who's scary... Stupid Forsworn...	
...Oooh... Cicero wants some Skyforge Steel! Sharp sharp, for easy stabbing...	
Oh! Oh! Maybe Cicero will go to Jorrvaskr and dance for the Companions! They'll... Um... On second thought... maybe not.	
He he he he he he he he he he.	
He he he... Crazy? Cicero? He he he he... That's madness...	
...and if I spy a singing bird, I'll snap its neck before it's heard...	
...and I said to the baker, 'You're not dead! You're a faker!' But if that's your wish, I'll oblige...	
...oh if I chance to see a cat, I'll feed its corpse to my pet rat... 	
...and he says to the man, 'That's not a horker! That's my wife!' Ha ha ha ha ha... Ah... I love that one... 	
...when I next meet, that fair maid Nelly, I'll plunge my knife into her belly...	
...tra la la, tra la lee, da da dum dum, dee dee...	
...madness is merry, and merriment's might, when the jester comes calling with his knife in the night...	
...What? Mother? Is that your voice I hear? Hmm... No, no... Just my head playing tricks... Foolish Cicero...	
Our sweet Lady is maiden, mother... and crone...	
...need to sharpen my blade... make it shiny, gleamy, and oh so deadly...	
...dear Cicero will keep you from harm, sweet Mother. Forever and always...	
...Cicero is hungry... ...need a sweetroll... or a carrot...	
...need to get Mother some flowers... pretty, pretty flowers...	
...must oil Mother soon... ...get all the hard to reach places...	
Cicero is at your service, oh great and powerful Listener!	
Let's kill someone.	
Cicero can talk for a moment. Just a moment. Then Mother must be... tended to.	
Oh, I do wish to get to know you better. But I must tend to mother. Maybe we can talk for just a moment...	
Yes, Listener? How can Cicero be of service?	
Humble Cicero lives to serve.	
Home again, home again! I'll return to the Night Mother straightaway!	
Oh, of course. Mother needs me, after all.
