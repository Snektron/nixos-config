I am sworn to carry your burdens.
A healing spell? Are you a priest?
I am your sword, and your shield.
Long life to you, Thane.
Honor to you, my Thane.
I am sworn to protect you.
Honored to see you again, my Thane.
As you wish, my Thane.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Is that one of the old ruins?
I have never seen anything quite like that.
Hey, look, a cave. I wonder what's inside.
Look over there, that's a Dwemer ruin.
You'll die this day, dragon!
Slay it! Slay the dragon!
Stupid dog.
You stupid excuse for a Nord!
Ahh, don't do that!
Skyrim belongs to the Nords!
I'll head back to Dragonsreach if you need me.
You don't belong here.
I'll head home if you need me.
I've never been more ready!
We heading out?
Wow, you must really need that.
You should have stayed in your precious forests, elf!
Not for you, not for anyone.
So this is Raven Rock, eh? Not all that much to look at.
I've come a long way to kill you.
I don't plan on being killed by the likes of you.
I don't have to know what you are to kill you.
What next, carnivorous rabbits?
I don't know whether to kill it or pet it.
That's a nice trick, but it won't save your skin.
For Whiterun!
She fights well enough, for a Skaal.
I've heard tales of the mushroom towers of Morrowind. Never thought I'd see one.
Someone's been busy.
There's something... wrong here.
Hmm. Reminds me of the standing stones back home.
