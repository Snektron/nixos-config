You have my attention.
Speak your mind.
It pleases me to see you again.
Now, if you don't mind, I've got a city to keep.
What do you want, milk drinker?
After Whiterun is retaken, Ulfric will pay in blood for his insolence.
Next time, deal with Avenicci.
We are honored to have you as Thane of our city, Dragonborn.
These Thalmor might not like to admit it, but as long as the Empire has Skyrim, the Empire has strength.
I'd rather be back at Whiterun, but while I'm here I might as well get some real news from the other parts of Skyrim.
We've got troubles enough without the Thalmor and their witch-hunts.
I've got this. Do what you need to do.
If you can arrange an end to the fighting, Dragonsreach is at your disposal.
We should get started.
