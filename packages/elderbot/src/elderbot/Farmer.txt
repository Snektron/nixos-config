I'm on my way to Solitude to join the Legion. A united Empire is better for everyone.
I was born and raised in Skyrim, but the Nords treat us like dirt.
I want to be on the right side.
I'm on my way to Windhelm to join up with the Stormcloaks. Ulfric has the right of it.
The Empire is in shambles. They've banned the worship of Talos.
It happened so fast. One minute the dragon was there, the next it was gone. Everything was destroyed.
No. I was too afraid to look. I don't know what we're going to do now. We have nothing left.
You're too kind. Thank you. Be careful and stay safe.
That's okay. We'll find a way to get by. Safe travels.
Thank you for your kindness.
There are dragons about, traveler. Be warned.
Then you've seen them, too. We lost our home, our livestock... We barely have enough gold to get by.
Thank you, traveler. Be safe and don't forget to keep an eye on the sky.
That's okay. We'll find a way to get by. Safe travels.
Thank you for the gold, traveler.
I'd stay away if I were you.
I'm on my way to a giant camp and I can't guarantee those beasts won't think you're part of the offering. Keep your distance and you shouldn't have anything to worry about.
Thanks. You take care of yourself, now.
I have everything under control. Thanks for offering.
The cow, of course. Others do it differently, but I've found that an annual offering usually keeps the giants away from our livestock. Some think it's superstition, but I believe it works. I've yet to have a giant kill any of my livestock.
It's tradition. We mark the animal as a way to let the giants know we're giving it to them willingly. Sort of a peace offering.
Either way this ends up, I'm headed to the inn.
My wife's going to kill me when I tell her we'll need to bring another cow.
